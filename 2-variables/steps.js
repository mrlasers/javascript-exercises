// create a variable named "bob" that can't be reassigned and give it the value "Robert"

// print bob to the console

// create a variable named "nameTag" that can be reassigned and give it the value "Bob"

// print nameTag to the console

// change the value of the nameTag variable to the value of the bob variable

// print nameTag to the console again

// # NUMBERS

// create a variable named "magicNumber" with let and set it equal to 5

// print magicNumber to the console

// change the value of magicNumber to 23

// print magicNumber to the console again

// change the value of magicNumber to 22 using the decrement operator

// print magicNumber to the console again

// change the value of magicNumber back to 23 using the increment operator

// print the magicNumber to the console again

// change the value of magicNumber to 46 using an assignment operator

// print magicNumber to the console again

// # STRINGS

// create a variable named helloMagicNumber with the value of "Hello, the magic number is 46!" using a template literal string

// print helloMagicNumber to the console

// create a variable to hold a magic number that you think Bob might like

// using a template literal string, create a variable with the message "Bob's magic number is X", where "X" is Bob's magic number

// print Bob's magic number message to the console

// print the data type of Bob's magic number to the console

// print the data type of Bob's magic number message to the console

// print the data type of the undefined value to the console (what do you think it will be?)

// print the data type of the null value to the console (what do you think this will be?)

// using the string concatenation operator, create the sentence "The magicNumber is '46' and its type is 'number', the value of null is 'null' and its type is 'object'"
